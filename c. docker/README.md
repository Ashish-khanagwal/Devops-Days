## What is Docker?

Docker is an open-source platform that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers. These containers package an application and all its dependencies into a standardized unit for software development, allowing applications to be easily deployed and run consistently across different environments.

## Why do we use Docker?

Docker simplifies the process of creating, deploying, and managing applications by providing lightweight, portable containers that can run on any system. Here are some key reasons for using Docker:

- Consistency: Docker containers ensure consistency in development, testing, and production environments, reducing the chances of "it works on my machine" issues.
- Isolation: Containers encapsulate applications and their dependencies, providing isolation from the underlying system and other applications.
- Portability: Docker containers can run on any system that supports Docker, making it easy to move applications between different environments.
- Efficiency: Docker containers are lightweight and share the host system's resources, making efficient use of system resources compared to traditional virtual machines.
- Scalability: Docker enables easy scaling of applications by deploying multiple containers across different hosts or clusters.

## Docker vs Virtual Machines

Docker containers and virtual machines (VMs) serve similar purposes but operate differently:

- Docker Containers:
  - Share the host OS kernel.
  - Lightweight, start quickly, and consume fewer resources.
  - Use container images for packaging applications and dependencies.
  - Provide process-level isolation.

- Virtual Machines:
  - Run on top of a hypervisor.
  - Each VM includes a full OS, consuming more resources.
  - Use disk images for packaging, which can be larger.
  - Provide full OS-level isolation.
    
In summary, Docker containers offer lightweight, efficient application isolation, while virtual machines offer stronger isolation at the expense of higher resource usage.

## Some Basic Docker Commands

- docker run: Create and start a new container based on an image.
- docker build: Build a Docker image from a Dockerfile.
- docker pull: Pull an image or a repository from a registry.
- docker push: Push an image or a repository to a registry.
- docker ps: List running containers.
- docker images: List available images.
- docker logs: View logs of a container.
- docker stop: Stop a running container.
- docker rm: Remove one or more containers.
- docker rmi: Remove one or more images.
